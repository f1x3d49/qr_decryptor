# QR Decrypt App

A Flutter mobile application that scans and decrypts QR codes generated by the companion web application. This app is part of a two-phase secure text sharing system.

## Features

- 📱 **QR Code Scanning**: Camera-based QR code scanning
- 🔓 **AES-256-CBC Decryption**: Secure decryption compatible with the web app
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface
- 🔐 **Secure**: Decryption happens locally on the device
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Works on Android and iOS

## How It Works

1. **Web App**: Users encrypt text and generate QR codes using the web application
2. **Mobile App**: This Flutter app scans the QR codes and decrypts the original text
3. **Security**: Uses AES-256-CBC encryption with random keys and IVs

## Architecture

### Encryption Compatibility
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC
- **Key Size**: 256 bits (randomly generated)
- **IV Size**: 128 bits (randomly generated)
- **Padding**: PKCS7
- **Format**: JSON payload containing `{encryptedText, key, iv, version}`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (2.15.1 or higher)
- Android Studio / Xcode for device deployment
- Physical device with camera (required for QR scanning)

### Dependencies
- `qr_code_scanner`: QR code scanning functionality
- `pointycastle`: AES encryption/decryption
- `permission_handler`: Camera permission management
- `crypto`: Cryptographic utilities

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd qr_decrypt_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform Setup

#### Android
- Camera permission is automatically requested
- Minimum SDK: API level 21 (Android 5.0)

#### iOS
- Camera usage description configured in Info.plist
- Minimum iOS version: 9.0

## Usage

1. **Launch the app** on your mobile device
2. **Tap "Start Scanning"** to open the camera
3. **Point the camera** at a QR code generated by the web app
4. **View the decrypted text** instantly
5. **Tap "Scan Another"** to decrypt more QR codes

## Security Features

- **Local Decryption**: All decryption happens on-device
- **No Data Storage**: Decrypted text is not saved permanently
- **Secure Transmission**: QR codes contain only encrypted data
- **Key Isolation**: Encryption keys are embedded in QR codes

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
flutter test
```

## Companion Web App

This mobile app works in conjunction with the web application that:
- Encrypts user input text
- Generates QR codes containing encrypted data
- Provides a download option for QR codes

## License

This project is part of a secure text sharing system demonstration.
